    "Overview of activities and objectives of this workbook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first part of this workbook will provide hands-on experience of how Perceptrons can be combined into Neural Networks/Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) to learn complex models.\n",
    "    - You should gain understanding of the key differences between the two algorithms, such as:\n",
    "        - Non-linear activation functions.\n",
    "        - Using Backpropagation to update (learn) the weights.\n",
    "        - How different nodes learn different aspects of the problem.\n",
    "    - You should also gain practical experience of how network architecture and training parameters affects the outcome.  \n",
    "      This will help you understand the difference between:\n",
    "        - **hyper-parameters** - for example network architectures and learning parameters,   \n",
    "          that can have significant impact on the ability to learn a good model from a data set.\n",
    "        - **hyper-parameter tuning** to allow fair comparisons between different Machine Learning algorithms.\n",
    "    - **The first assessed activity** is producing code to **measure and visualise** the impact of network size on performance.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the second part of this workbook you will implement a simple Machine Learning workflow - sometimes called a *pipeline*.  \n",
    "   - Workflows are a key part of any Data Science or AI project because they let us  do **fair**, **systematic** and **automated** comparisons between algorithms.\n",
    "    - You will learn how to format the *labels* in your dataset and configure the output layers of your MLP, for problems having more than two different labels.  \n",
    "      This type of problem- known as *multi-class learning* is very common- such as the Iris dataset.\n",
    "   - **The second assessed activity** is to implement a general purpose workflow for comparing different algorithms on a new dataset.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In the third part of this workbook you will learn how use an MLP to a classic image-based problems: learning to recognise hand-written digits."

    "  - So, outputs of hidden layers become the inputs to subsequent hidden layers, or the final output layer. \n",
    "  - Hidden nodes tend to learn different aspects of the problem space, building more complex decision boundaries and are therefore able to solve more complex problems.\n",
